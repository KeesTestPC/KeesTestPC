## Hey, welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹


### What I do
I code using Microsoft Visual Studio, and I usually use Microsoft Forms to make applications. I am still learning though, so I'm not the best at it.

### What I'm working on
I'm currently working on a Windows Forms Application called "Discord Webhook Manager" (not final name) and when it's done, I will most likely publish it on GitHub... maybe.
